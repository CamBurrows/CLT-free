# CLT-free
CLT free is an app for freelancers and those seeking freelancers for work in Charlotte, NC. Instead of outsourcing your project to a different country or state, hire your neighbor instead.

Reason for development:
Given the choice and at equal cost, most people prefer to spend their money within their community.  In addition to the obvious financial benefits for the area in question (for us, Charlotte), this helps foster a sense of community.  Users can either put themselves and their skills out there for others to see and hire them, or they can post a job and let freelancers offer them their services.

In development:
-The ability to post messages on jobs to directly interact with other users inside the website.  This could be used as a defacto bidding opportunity, as freelancers could bid a set price for completing the job.  While we aren't going to explicitly describe it as such to users, it seems likely to be an emergent organic feature.

Further Development Ideas:
-This idea is easily portable to other locales.  With minimal editing you could make this work anywhere from San Diego to Washington DC.  Some services are more easily portable than others (Landscaping vs Web Design).  Other services that seem easily portable are more location specific than you would initially think (for example Legal Services, due to the variablility of state laws).
-Creating an admin account in order to moderate postings.
-Allow a user to update their posts.  Under current implementation, they would have to delete and remake their post in order to edit it.
